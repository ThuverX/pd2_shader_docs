title: Shader File Format
category: Shader
---

This file describes the `.shaders` file format used by Payday 2. It's a custom format used to store the shaders used by the game.

(All values are stored in little endian.)

## Headers

The file is structured as follows:
* The start of the file is the padding and the number of [Objects](#objects):
    * Either `count` or `-1` (4 bytes)
    * If the previous value was `-1`, then this is `padding` (4 bytes)
    * And if the previous value was `padding` then this is the `count` instead (4 bytes)
* A list of [Objects](#objects):
    * Each object has a `type` according to [Types](#object-types) (4 bytes)
    * A reference id so this object can be referenced to by other objects (4 bytes)
    * The `size` of the object (4 bytes)
    * The data of the object (`size` bytes)

## Objects

### Object types

| Type | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Shader` | `0x7F3552D1` | Contains a list of techniques with shader passes |
| `Shader Pass` | `0x214b1aaf` | Contains render and sampler state along with a vertex and pixel shader |
| `Shader Library` | `0x12812C1A` | Contains a list of shader templates |

### Shader Library

The Shader Library Object contains a list of [shader templates](#shader).

It is structured as follows:
* `count`, the number of shader templates (4 bytes)
* A list of references to shader templates:
    * The [lookup8 hash](/docs/lookup8) of the shader templates name (8 bytes)
    * The reference id to the shader template object (4 bytes)

### Shader

The Shader Object contains a list of techniques each containing a list of passes.

It is structured as follows:
* `count`, the number of techniques (4 bytes)
* A list of techniques:
    * The [lookup8 hash](/docs/lookup8) of the technique name (8 bytes)
    * `count`, the number of passes (4 bytes)
        * reference id to the shader pass object (4 bytes)

### Shader pass

The Shader Pass Object contains the bulk of the relevant data for the shaders. It contains the render and sampler state along with the vertex and pixel shader.

It is structured as follows:
* `render_state_count`, the number of render states (4 bytes)
* A list of render states according to [Render States](#render-states)
* `sampler_state_count`, the number of sampler states (4 bytes)
* A list of sampler states according to [Sampler States](#sampler-states)
* `vertex_shader_size`, the size of the vertex shader data (4 bytes)
* `vertex_shader_data`, the vertex shader data (`vertex_shader_size` bytes)
* `pixel_shader_size`, the size of the pixel shader data (4 bytes)
* `pixel_shader_data`, the pixel shader data (`pixel_shader_size` bytes)

## Render States

A Render State contains information how this shader should render.

It is structured as follows:
* `id`, the [D3DRENDERSTATETYPE](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/direct3d9/d3drenderstatetype) as a 32 bit integer (4 bytes)
* `b`, whether is value is a `int` or a `long` (1 byte)
* if `b` is equal to `0`
    * `value4`, the value of the render state (4 bytes)
* else if `b` is not equal to `0`
    * `value8`, the value of the render state (8 bytes)

## Sampler States

A Sampler State contains information about how a sampler should sample a texture.

It is structured as follows:
* `id`, the id the sampler (4 bytes)
* `state_count`, the number of state for this sampler (4 bytes)
* A list of states:
    * `id`, the [D3DSAMPLERSTATETYPE](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/direct3d9/d3dsamplerstatetype) as a 32 bit integer (4 bytes)
    * `b`, whether is value is a `int` or a `long` (1 byte)
    * if `b` is equal to `0`
        * `value4`, the value of the render state (4 bytes)
    * else if `b` is not equal to `0`
        * `value8`, the value of the render state (8 bytes)
